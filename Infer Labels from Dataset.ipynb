In a randomized clinical trial, the authors compared the use of postoperative subconjunctival injections of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in 19 eyes with a single intraoperative application of subconjunctival mitomycin (MMC) at the filtering site in 20 eyes at high risk for failure of glaucoma filtering surgery. Six months after surgery, intraocular pressures averaged 10.9 +/- 5.3 mmHg (mean +/- standard deviation) in the MMC-treated eyes versus 14.2 +/- 5.5 mmHg in the 5-FU-treated eyes (P = 0.08) and were less than or equal to 12 mmHg in 60.0% of MMC-treated eyes and 21.1% of 5-FU-treated eyes (P = 0.03). Mitomycin-treated eyes were receiving an average of 0.3 +/- 0.5 medications for intraocular pressure control, and 5-FU-treated eyes were receiving an average of 1.1 +/- 1.1 medications (P = 0.01). Drug-induced corneal epithelial defects were seen in nine 5-FU-treated eyes and in no MMC-treated eyes (P = 0.0004). These results suggest that intraoperative MMC may be a viable alternative to postoperative 5-FU, with lower overall intraocular pressures, decreased dependence on postoperative ocular antihypertensive medications, and decreased corneal toxicity.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m---> 54\u001b[1;33m \u001b[0mresults\u001b[0m \u001b[1;33m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0minfer_sent_labels\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mlist1\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m)\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[0;32m     55\u001b[0m \u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m     56\u001b[0m \u001b[0mlist2\u001b[0m \u001b[1;33m=\u001b[0m \u001b[1;34m\"Trabeculectomy with mitomycin. A comparative study with fluorouracil. We conducted a prospective, randomized study to compare mitomycin with fluorouracil for efficacy and safety as an adjunct to trabeculectomy in eyes with glaucoma with poor surgical prognosis. Thirty-two eyes of 32 patients were randomly allocated to either mitomycin (17 eyes) or fluorouracil therapy (15 eyes). Mitomycin (0.2 mg) was applied only once during trabeculectomy, and fluorouracil (5 mg) was subconjunctivally injected 10 times in the 2 weeks after surgery. Fifteen eyes (88%) in the mitomycin group and seven (47%) in the fluorouracil group achieved an intraocular pressure of less than or equal to 20 mm Hg without antiglaucoma medication. The follow-up period was 7 to 12 months. Corneal complications were less common in the group given mitomycin than in that given fluorouracil (12% vs 53%).
